# 🌐 SLI, SLO, SLA — Explained Simply

Think of a **pizza delivery service** 🍕 (instead of servers).

## 🔑 The Three Terms

### 1. SLA (Service Level Agreement)  
👉 A *promise* you make to customers.  
- **Business-facing**.  
- If you break it → customer gets compensation.  

**Example:**  
- “We promise your pizza will arrive within **30 minutes**, 95% of the time.”  
- If it’s late, you get a refund.

### 2. SLO (Service Level Objective)  
👉 A *goal* the engineering team sets to stay within the SLA.  
- **Internally focused**.  
- Usually stricter than SLA (to give buffer).  

**Example:**  
- Internal goal: deliver 97% of pizzas within **25 minutes**.  
- This way, you’re safely above the SLA target.

### 3. SLI (Service Level Indicator)  
👉 The actual **measurement/metric**.  
- **The number you track**.  
- Defines success/failure quantitatively.  

**Example:**  
- % of pizzas delivered within 25 minutes in the last 30 days.  
- If it drops below 97% → you’re missing the SLO.

## 💻 In Tech Terms
- **SLI** = The metric (e.g., 99.9% of HTTP requests return < 500ms).  
- **SLO** = The goal (e.g., 99.9% over 30 days).  
- **SLA** = The legal/business promise (e.g., 99.5% uptime, or customer gets credits).

## ✅ One-Liner Summary
- **SLI = What you measure.**  
- **SLO = What you aim for.**  
- **SLA = What you promise (with consequences).**
